Scrumwall
---------------------------------------------
This is an application to simulate a whiteboard that has columns and post-it notes. The idea is to support
scrum- and kanbanboards, but the uses are limited only by your imagination. The words that always rings in
the back of our heads are simplicity, usability and functionality.
